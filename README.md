# List Manager with Data Collections

> A Vue.js, Vuex, Store Manager

This single page application allows for updates to the data collection, and will eventually persist to localStorage. The app uses Bootstrap for frontend CSS styling and Vuex for data and state management.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# to see a demo at localhost:8080

```
